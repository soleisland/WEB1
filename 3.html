<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages
and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10]
and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</P>
